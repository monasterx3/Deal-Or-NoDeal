<p>This is a simple game of deal or no deal just like the game show. First choose one of numbered 26 briefcases at the start of the game.</p>
<p>Each briefcase holds a cash amount from $1 to $1,000,000 </p>

<p>In the first round, the contestant chooses six cases to eliminate from play, one at a time. Each case is opened as it is chosen, and the amount inside is removed from the board. After the sixth pick, you will be made an offer for your case. </p>

<p>Each time an offer is rejected, you must continue to select more cases. In each round you must select fewer cases before an offer is propsed by the banker: five in the second round, four in the third, three in the fourth, two in the fifth. Beyond the fifth round, you select one case at a time, receiving a new offer from the Banker after each. </p>

<p> The ninth and final offer comes when there are only two cases left in play: the one originally chosen by you and one other. If you reject the final offer, you may either keep the chosen case or trade it for the last case. You win the amount in the case taken. </p>

<p> Available Prizes: $1, $5, $10, $25, $50, $75, $100, $200, $300, $400, $500, $750, $1000, $5000, $10000, $15000, $25000, $50000, $75000, $100000, $200000, $300000, $400000, $500000, $750000, $1000000,</p>
